# refactor-cpp-class-name
A tool to change cpp class name, and change the file names and includes too. This is because I usually refactor them, and QtCreator does not do it all at once.

# Usage
   ./ref-cpp-class-name  old_classname  new_classname
  
# Example
   I am in the root folder of my project!
    
    ./ref-cpp-class-name  FooManager  FooMgr 
    
   Done.
